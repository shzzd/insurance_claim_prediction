# Project Problem
A company wants to know about the upcoming claim of from policyholders. They decide to make a program using machine learning approach to predict incurance claim.
The company keep the data name in the dataset for the privacy issue.

The dataset is made with 59 features and 595212 instances but its highly imbalanced.

The dataset has unknown values

# Approach

Explore the dataset

Clean the dataset and imputing in some cases

Feature scaling

Balance the dataset

Use feature selection technique or pca

Train and test split

Model training

Model performance

# Outcome

train accuracy:  0.9809
validation accuracy:  0.9789
test accuracy:  0.9791
auc score:  0.9903

# Methodology

Exploratory data analysis

Data preprocessing

Feature scaling

Balance data

Feature selection

Train and test split

Model training

Model performance

Train: 70%
Validation: 15%
Test: 15%
Data cleaning
- drop column ID
- drop unknown values
